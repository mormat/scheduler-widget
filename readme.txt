Features :
- Four view modes available: day, week, month and year
- Events can be displayed by groups (for instance : tasks by persons or reservations by rooms)
- Filter hook to programmatically override the properties of the scheduler
- Drag and drop support

Note: this widget renders best on a full width page.
